/**
 * This class holds/manages a certain type of info about what is present in the browser tab associated with a {@link BaseWindow}. We can assume that:<br/>
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>when a browser tab reconnects after loosing connection for a while and finds the server side window instance is still there we can assume that this information is still present in the browser;</li>
 * 		<li>when a browser tab gets refreshed (F5) all this information can be considered as lost on client (as it's a fresh tab basically).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This info can fall into 2 categories:
 * <ul>
 * 		<li>when a browser tab gets refreshed (F5) some things need to be re-sent right away (for example main form url, so that the browser can start reloading everything, types with client side conversions for all services that might get accessed client side any-time);</li>
 * 		<li>when a browser tab gets refreshed (F5) the information is gone and we can clear it server-side as well as the refreshed tab will reload all that anyway. (for example loaded forms, form/component client side conversions, used containers)</li>
 * </ul>
