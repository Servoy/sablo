	 * before being sent to the client) to this method (identified by method name) on any component on the current window will be executed. The previous calls are discarded.<br/><br/>
	 *
	 * For example when the user clicks a button, an event handler on the server that executes lots of code might end up calling .requestFocus() on many components for many different forms on this window.
	 * But to keep things fast, only the last requestFocus() is really relevant and only that really needs to get executed on the client - there is no use in executing any of the others.
	 * So by marking requestFocus() with this flag in the .spec you can achieve that.
