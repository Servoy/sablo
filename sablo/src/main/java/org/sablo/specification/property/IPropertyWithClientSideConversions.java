/**
 * Some property types need to implement from-server and to-server conversions client-side. (so js conversions that happen in the browser).<br/>
 * For example dates are not supported in json so they will probably be converted to milliseconds or strings before being sent from browser to server over the websocket.<br/><br/>
 *
 * This is a tagging interface (but not only that) that says "this property type also has js conversions browser-side". It is needed because, for example, if a service or component declare this
 * type as a sync API call return value type or a handler argument type (components only) or if their model declares such a type in a property - but no value is sent for it from
 * the server, the browser-side client-to-server conversion still need to be called on them anyway before being sent to server when a new value appears; that means that server-side sablo needs
 * to provide this information to the browser (when a service or component that uses such properties is sent to a browser window/tab, the type information for types that implement
 * IPropertyWithClientSideConversions needs to be sent along with it).<br/><br/>
 *
 * Simple types that need client side conversions will just write their name as a string when {@link IPropertyWithClientSideConversions#writeClientSideTypeName(PropertyDescription)} gets called.<br/><br/>
 *
 * More complex types (arrays, objects of different keys etc., ...) that can have different types of sub-elements (usually the ones that also register as {@link TypesRegistry#addTypeFactory(String, org.sablo.specification.property.types.IPropertyTypeFactory)}
 * can choose to write an array of two elements when {@link IPropertyWithClientSideConversions#writeClientSideTypeName(PropertyDescription)} is called where the first element will be
 * the factory name and the second element will be the factory's param. For example for a custom object you might return something like ["o","tab"] - where 'o' means it's a custom object
 * and "tab" says the name it has in .spec.<br/><br/>
 *
 * Note that an IPropertyWithClientSideConversions can decide if a particular property of that type actually needs to use client side conversions or not by returning true or false (and writing
 * or not in 'w') in {@link IPropertyWithClientSideConversions#writeClientSideTypeName(JSONWriter, String, PropertyDescription)}.
