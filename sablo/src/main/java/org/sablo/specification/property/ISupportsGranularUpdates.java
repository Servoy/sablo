 * A property type that is able to send back an forth granular updates.
 * It would probably have a large content that can only slightly change, in which case there's no point in sending the whole content via toJSON() all the time.<br/><br/>
 *
 * These property types will probably define a JSON protocol of their own and use it in all 3 conversion methods: {@link #fromJSON(Object, Object, IDataConverterContext)}, {@link #toJSON(JSONWriter, String, Object, DataConversion)} and {@link #changesToJSON(JSONWriter, String, Object, DataConversion, boolean)}.
