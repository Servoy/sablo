	 *
	 * We cannot store this in the PropertyDescription objects only (when parsing the spec file) and use it from there because the same custom/nested
	 * type (so PropertyDescription) can be used in multiple subtrees in properties in the spec file, sometimes with pushToServer 'reject' and sometimes
	 * with pushToServer 'shallow' for example somewhere in parents. So the same PropertyDescription's sub-properties can sometimes be 'reject',
	 * sometimes 'shallow' etc. (If we would want to do this - store it directly in PDs, we must take care to clone those nested custom object/array PDs
	 * and have a different PropertyDescription for them in each different place they are used in; and also client-side sent PDs (type and pushToServer info)
	 * then would need to work correctly with this as well...)

	 * @see PushToServerEnum#combineWithParent(PushToServerEnum) for details on how nested pushToServer levels are computed.
