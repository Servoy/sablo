/**
 * Types that want to add special behavior to the pushToServer setting from spec files can implement this interface.
 * Some types want to be able to receive messages from client side even though no pushToServer is set in .spec file for them (not even allow) because
 * they need some internal protocol to be operational.
 *
 * For example a type might want to request certain data from server without modifying any data on the server, so in spec it doesn't have 'allow' but the request
 * from client shouldn't be blocked by the system. The type will be responsible for blocking that itself based on
 * {@link IConvertedPropertyType#fromJSON(Object, Object, IBrowserConverterContext)}'s {@link IBrowserConverterContext#getPushToServerValue()}.
