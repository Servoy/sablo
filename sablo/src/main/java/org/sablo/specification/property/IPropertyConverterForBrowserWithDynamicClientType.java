/**
 * A property type that implements this interface needs to/from json conversions server-side when communicating with the browser
 * but it also can require random client-side conversions (for incomming data from server). For example a type sending random data types
 * might want to sometimes send no client side conversion (for numbers, booleans, strings) but send a 'date' client side conversions when the data it contains is a Date. <br/><br/>
 *
 * So sometimes client-side needs to perform some conversions but not always the same type (so this conversions types are not known initially are not available client side via the {@link ClientSideTypesState} mechanism).<br/><br/>
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if for this type {@link #toJSON(JSONWriter, String, Object, PropertyDescription, Object)} is called it will have to write both the type and the value using {@link JSONUtils#writeConvertedValueWithClientType(JSONWriter, String, String, java.util.concurrent.Callable)}. That means that the caller does not handle client side types separately in a special way.
 * <li>if for this type {@link #toJSONWithDynamicClientSideType(JSONWriter, String, Object, PropertyDescription, IBrowserConverterContext)} is called it will just write the value and return the client side type to be used (can be null). This means that the caller has special logic for sending the client side type for this property's value. This can be used to optimize for example large viewports with the same type.</li>
 * </ul>
