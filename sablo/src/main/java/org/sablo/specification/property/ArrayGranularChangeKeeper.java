/**
 * NOTE: this class can be used for keeping track of changes in any array-like structure, not just in the viewport of Servoy foundsets.
 *
 * This class receives a sequence of array (foundset viewport change) events (inserts/deletes/change by ref/updates) and processes them
 * so that in the end it can provide an equivalent sequence of events (not necessarily the initial ones)
 * that would have the same result as the received ones but who's indexes always reflect the final (after-
 * the-fact) array (viewport) indexes.<br/><br/>
 *
 * That helps in that less changes might be sent to client/browser and that the client component, when
 * receiving them can rely on indexes from the already processed array (foundset viewport).<br/><br/>
 *
 * <b>For example:<br/>
 * <pre>
 *   Initial viewport: 1 2 3 4 5
 *   Operations: update index 4 (with 5u), insert 2 (a and b) at index 1, delete index 0
 *   => Final viewport: a b 2 3 4 5u
 * </pre>
 *
 * Above you can see that first operation (update index 4) does not reflect the index from the final viewport.<br/>
 * Same goes for the insert (indexes are not the ones from final viewport).<br/>
 * So this class outputs a client-component friendly set of operations that are equivalent to the one above:<br/>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Equivalent operations: insert 1 at index 0, update index 1, update index 5
 * </pre>
 *
 * which results in the same final viewport, but where the component can rely on updating the data from
 * indexes 1 and 5 after inserting at idx 0 in the viewport. So the component can take these operations one
 * by one and correct the UI using the data from those indexes in the final viewport which are correct.<br/><br/>
 *
 * The algorithm is based on keeping after each operation a list of 'untouched'/'partially touched' intervals (values that have not
 * changed in the viewport or changed only partially, with initial bounds and new bounds) and when the equivalent sequence is asked for,
 * compute it based on this set of unchanged intervals.<br/><br/>
 *
 * <b>In the example above, the unchanged intervals</b> would work like this (in round brackets are the unchanged indexes that correspond to the initial viewport):<br/>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Initially: [0, 4]
 *   After update index 4    => [0(0), 3(3)]
 *   After insert 2 at idx 1 => [0(0), 0(0)] [3(1), 5(3)]
 *   After delete idx 0      => [3(1), 5(3)]
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then each gap between these SORTED unchanged intervals can be translated into one insert or delete as needed
 * + one update as needed (or one delete as needed followed by one insert as needed). The old and new indexes
 * of each unchanged interval have all the information that is needed to generate the equivalent sequence of
 * operations.
